		<h3>We begin with the Deng Dynasty...</h3>
		<p>As a child, Moon was raised on the tastes of tradition. Generations of noodle dishes with spicy sauces and strange seafoods. Some were less desired at the younger age, but with time, Moon soon came to love all the strange cuisine of the East, even the sea cucumbers and chicken feet.</p>
		<p>However, ever since moving to the Americas, Moon has felt quite lost in the West. There are no roaming carts full of steaming noodle bowls with mushrooms, no fresh produce in the city center market, waiting to be creatively cooked. She has felt...tossed from tradition.</p>
		<p>Her ethnic background soon came to the rescue. Drawing upon the recips and homestyle cooking of her ancestors, Moon began to revolutionize Asian dining in her small town of Corning, NY. She hopes to share her findings nationwide, helping others who like her, feel tossed from the family roots.</p>

		<h3>...and end in French patisserie.</h3>
		<p>Brizzle comes from a long line of boulangerie on the street corner of 8th and 57th. His grandfather made baguettes in for tired soldiers of the Second World War, and his great-great-great grandfather was serving croissants to the bourgiouse of the French Revolution. He has inherited the delicate taste of balancing the sweetness of sugar and the flakiness of dough, into the perfect mid-afternoon delicacy.</p>
		<p>Recently though, the famous boulangerie of 8th and 57th was reclaimed by the city, planned to become a hotspot cafe for the new hip teenagers. Decades and centuries of flour, fame, and fortune of the Brizzle household were simply...tossed to the wayside</p>
		<p>Still in France, Brizzle moved down the street to 8th and 56th, where he watches the constrctuion of the hotspot cafe in disappointment. As a stress baker, he often bakes the family recipes in abundance, punching his anger into mixing bowls and rising dough. By a miraculous event, his upstairs neighbors began to take notice of the fragrant smells coming through their windows and vents. Upon discovering Brizzle's pastries, they immediately encouraged him to build up his own fortune and start up the Brizzle Boulangerie once more.</p>
