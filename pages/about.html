      <h3> Sailor </h3>
      </div>
        <p> Sailor found her true calling in life when she grew tired of playing fruit ninja.
         Her family taught her the importance of eating vegetables, and she was disappointed in the lack of vegetables in the app.
         This motivated her to study computer science in college so she could create the counterpart fruit ninja always needed. </p>
        <p> A basic idea, an insatisfaction with naturally sweet fruits, grew to be her life consuming passion.
         She became known as <em> Lettuce Cut </em> by all who knew her, and her new app took off wildly in popularity. </p>
         <p>Lettuce Cut, the app was just the beginning. After learning the power of her influence, she took to sharing health focused recipes to promote children's health.
         The majority of the fresh and healthy recipes are from her, as she does her part to humanity. </p>

      <h3> Brett </h3>
      </div>
      <p> Brett found food as a young child. From a young age he became obsesseed with eating every day.
       This obsession led him into many peculiar circumstances, often eating things he later learned to regret.
       In the pages of recipes, you may find dishes that have no appeal, and these are surely from him. He does not include them to persuade others to eat them.
       Rather, he includes them as part of his ethos, calling others to recognize the experience he has, and that he knows what tastes good, by having known what tasted bad. </p>
       <p>As he grew older, he had a unique opportunity to live abroad in France and Belgium. This experience widened his horizons and exposed him to many new dishes.
       While Sailor's dishes are health-oriented, Brett's dishes are pleaseure-oriented. He includes recipes full of flavor and personality. </p>
       <p>One of his favorite stories to tell is of him going to restuarants with his mother. She would order the item with the least amount of calories, and he would order the most calorie-packed item.
       She almost always hated her meals, while he loved every last one of his. If you were looking for a scrumptuous recipe for festivities, follow a Brett recipe. You're sure to love it! </p>
